   - Verify it appears immediately in the other instance

### 2. Sticker Store Testing

1. **Open Sticker Store**
   - In the sticker picker, click "Get more sticker packs"
   - Browse the sticker store interface

2. **Pack Preview**
   - Click "Preview" on any sticker pack
   - Verify all stickers in the pack load correctly
   - Test the preview modal functionality

3. **Download Packs**
   - Download a sticker pack (all packs are free by default)
   - Verify the pack appears in your sticker picker
   - Test sending stickers from the newly downloaded pack

### 3. Error Handling

   - Verify error messages appear appropriately
   - Test retry functionality

2. **Invalid Stickers**
   - Check console for any image loading errors
   - Verify fallback UI appears for broken sticker images

## 🗄️ Database Verification

### Check Seeded Data

```javascript
// Connect to MongoDB and verify data
use zaloclone

// Check sticker packs
db.stickerpacks.find().pretty()

// Check individual stickers
db.stickers.find().pretty()

// Check user sticker ownership (after downloading)
db.userstickerpacks.find().pretty()
```

### Expected Default Packs

1. **Basic Emotions** (6 stickers)
   - Happy, Love, Laughing, Sad, Angry, Surprised

2. **Reactions** (6 stickers)
   - Thumbs Up, Thumbs Down, Clapping, OK Hand, Victory, Fire

3. **Animals** (6 stickers)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Stickers Not Loading**
   - Check if seeding script ran successfully
   - Verify backend server is running
   - Check browser console for network errors

2. **Pack Download Not Working**
   - Ensure user is authenticated
   - Check API endpoints are responding
   - Verify database connection

3. **Real-time Updates Not Working**
   - Check Socket.IO connection status

GET http://localhost:5000/api/stickers/user/packs

# Download a pack (requires auth)
POST http://localhost:5000/api/stickers/user/pack/{packId}
```
